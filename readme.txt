OS/IDE: Windows 10 // VS Code

Running Executables: 
  Process Image DB: ./bin/proc_img_db.exe <file path> <feature vector (integer, in order they appear in report)>
  Process Target:   ./bin/proc_target.exe <image name> <feature> <file where it's written>
    Note: Because of the behavior and logical flow of my program, if you're running for a task 
          using 2 histograms, there is no need to specify the name of the csv file. If this causes problems
          I included them in my submission to account for that. 
  
For my extension, you can just run 
  ./bin/proc_target <image name> <6 or 7> <csv file name> 
      Again, no need to include the name.
